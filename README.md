# Deep-Learning-Based-Pneumonia-Detection
CNN,Resnet50,VGG16,InceptionNet 
The application of machine learning and artificial
intelligence in medicine is expanding. This is especially true for
medical fields that use a lot of biological images and where the
gathering and processing of a lot of digital images is necessary
for the diagnostic processes. The analysis of medical images
using machine learning increases the consistency and accuracy
of reporting. This study reviews the use of machine learning
algorithms to analyze chest radiographs to improve decision-
making and reach the correct diagnosis. This work mainly
focuses on developing processing models using deep learning
techniques based on convolutional neural networks such as **CNN
VGG16, ResNet-50, and InceptionNet**. These models aim to
help with the classification problem of determining whether
there are pneumonia-related abnormalities in the chest x-ray
and classifying his x-rays into two categories according to the
detection results. increase.
